FINGERINGS PROJECT README

MARK PENG & STEPHEN KOO


This project is organized in the following manner:
	train/
		training data set
	dev/ 
		development data set
	obsolete/
		old and obsolete files
	test.py
		sandbox for testing (TODO: testing/sanity-check harness for everything?)
	util.py
		helpful utility functions and classes for computations
	learning.py
		tools for learning parameters on linear chain CRFs
	inference.py
		tools for computing inferences on linear chain CRFs
	features.py
		feature extraction function(s)
	parse.py
		parsing functionality for Lilypond data
	run.py
		the main entry point for the project: shell and trainer

Fingerings can be represented in LilyPond in multiple ways:
	With a dash followed by the number:
		ees-3

	With a caret and quotation marks:
		a16^"1"

Possible features:
	Unary features: Current note and fingering
	Binary features: Fingerings of current and previous notes
	Other features:
		Feature for current fingering and previous note
		Feature for current fingering and next note
		Feature for gap between current and previous notes AND gap between current and previous fingerings
		Feature for current fingering and gap between current and previous notes (if gap is large, then 2 and 3 less likely)
		Feature for current fingering and gap between current and next notes (if gap is large, then... 3,4,5 less likely?)
