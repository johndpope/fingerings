FINGERINGS PROJECT README

MARK PENG & STEPHEN KOO


This project is organized in the following manner:
	train/
		training data set
	dev/ 
		development data set
	obsolete/
		old and obsolete files
	test.py
		sandbox for testing (TODO: testing/sanity-check harness for everything?)
	util.py
		helpful utility functions and classes for computations
	learning.py
		tools for learning parameters on linear chain CRFs
	inference.py
		tools for computing inferences on linear chain CRFs
	features.py
		feature extraction function(s)
	parse.py
		parsing functionality for Lilypond data
	run.py
		the main entry point for the project: shell and trainer

Try out the fingering generator from the provided shell interface. The example given below is an excerpt from Bach's Sinfonia No. 3:

    > python run.py shell --parameters=weights
    >> viterbi fis'' g a c, b e fis g b, a d e fis a, g fis' e d cis b' a g
    >> gibbs_best fis'' g a c, b e fis g b, a d e fis a, g fis' e d cis b' a g
    >> gibbs_dist fis'' g a c, b e fis g b, a d e fis a, g fis' e d cis b' a g

To try out further examples on your own, refer to the LilyPond documentation for the note syntax.
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.16/Documentation/notation/writing-pitches
We utilize the "relative octave entry" mode, with the very first note written in absolute octave mode for reference.
